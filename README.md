[![Kasualix's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Kasualix)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

**Self Intro:**
1. A Chinese, HZNU student, mod developer & translator, and a modpacker.
2. This GitHub account is mainly for contributing to other projects, but you can see my own projects at [MCTeamPotato](https://github.com/MCTeamPotato).
3. My Discord: Kasualix#5415.
4. Profile picture: my love, a dragon, [Tankofpacer](https://b23.tv/260c025).

**Some Important Tips:**

1. What many MC mod developers write is shit. (So many MC modpacks are equal to shit mountains.)
2. Don't make MC modpacks, or you'll experience suffering.
3. To live, is to experience suffering.
4. If you think the 2 is conflict with  the 3, you're too young, and need to see _Violet Evergarden_.
