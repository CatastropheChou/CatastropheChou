[![Kasualix's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Kasualix)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

This account is mainly for contributing to other projects, but you can see my own projects in MCTeamPotato.

Some important hints:

1. What many MC mod authors write is shit. So many MC modpacks are equal to shit mountains.

2. Don't make MC modpacks, or you will be unfortunate.
