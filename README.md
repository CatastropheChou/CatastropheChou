**Self Intro:**
1. A Chinese, mod developer & translator, modpacker, and selective blindness patient.
2. This GitHub account is now only mainly for contributing to other projects, but you can see my own projects mainly at [MCTeamPotato](https://github.com/MCTeamPotato).
3. My Discord: Kasualix#5415.
4. Profile picture: my love, a dragon, [Tankofpacer](https://b23.tv/260c025).

**Some Important Tips:**

1. What many MC mod developers write is shit. (So many MC modpacks are equal to shit mountains.)
2. it doesn't help that a large portion of MC community are children.
3. Every community is toxic.
4. Don't make MC modpacks, or you'll experience suffering.
5. To live, is to experience suffering.
6. If you think the 4 is conflict with  the 5, you're too young, and need to grow up and see _Violet Evergarden by Kyoto Animation_.
